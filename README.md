# web-programming-final-proj
# attempted to implement a fitness tracking app using a Node.js/Express backend and Supabase as the database. Due to time constraints and repeated technical issues with deployment and database connections, the project is incomplete.
# What went wrong: Deployment failed repeatedly due to memory limits and timeout errors and Supabase connection did not work properly
# Ran out of time troubleshooting due to overlapping deadlines and other finals
# What I would have done with more time: Finalize Supabase integration, CRUD operations and smooth final deployment on render
